# Rig Roadmap (V1)

A new systems language that transpiles to Zig.

## Mission

Build the language we'd want to write systems code in: **Zig-fast, Rust-safe, Ruby-elegant**, with explicit ownership, visible effects, and a Lisp-clean intermediate representation.

## Architecture

```
Rig source
  → Parser                 (rig.grammar + src/rig.zig)
       BaseLexer  + Lexer  (token rewriter)
       BaseParser + Parser (sexp rewriter)
  → semantic IR            (S-expressions; the grammar emits the
                            normalized shape directly via Nexus
                            tag-literal-at-child support)
  → effects checker        (src/effects.zig — fallibility visibility)
  → ownership checker      (src/ownership.zig — borrow / move / drop)
  → Zig emitter            (src/emit.zig — Zig 0.16 backend)
  → zig build              (Zig 0.16 toolchain)
```

Rig owns lexing, parsing, normalization, semantic checking, and lowering. Zig owns the optimizer, codegen, linker, and platform support.

## Milestones

### M0 — Parser online ✅
- `rig.grammar`, `src/rig.zig`, `build.zig` written.
- `bin/rig parse examples/hello.rig` emits raw S-expression.
- Golden snapshots locked for hello + SPEC §V1 test cases + spacing/sigils.
- Conflict count: 34 (after pruning unused pointer-type forms in M4.5b).

### M1 — Parser sexp rewriter ✅
- `Parser` (rewriter wrapper) in `src/rig.zig` produces normalized semantic IR.
- After Nexus 0.10.x+ tag-literal-at-child support, the grammar emits the
  normalized shape directly for nearly every form; the rewriter handles
  only one inspection-requiring transform (for-source ownership wrapper
  promotion).
- `docs/SEMANTIC-SEXP.md` documents the IR.

### M2 — Ownership checker ✅
- `src/ownership.zig`: implements SPEC §"Ownership Checker V1".
- Errors are source-pointed and sigil-aware.

### M3 — Zig emitter ✅
- `src/emit.zig`: semantic IR → Zig 0.16 source (Juicy Main, `std.Io`).
- Emitted Zig passes `zig ast-check` for every supported example.

### M4 — `rig` binary ✅
- `rig parse | tokens | normalize | check | build | run` all functional.
- `bin/rig run examples/hello.rig` prints "hello, rig".

### M4.5 — Semantic correctness hardening ✅
After the GPT-5.5 audit surfaced semantic-drift bugs (auto-`try`, hidden
fallibility, plain-use holes, shadow-lookup direction, etc.), an
intermediate hardening milestone landed:

- **M4.5a:** New `src/effects.zig` (fallibility checker). `build`/`run`
  run the full checker pipeline. Plain `.src` value-use now checks
  move/drop/write-borrow. Bound borrows release on drop/reassign. Shadow
  lookup scans reverse. Emitter is dumb (no auto-`try`, no signature
  mutation). `pub pub fn` fixed. `bindingKindOf` errors on unknown.
- **M4.5b:** Branch snapshot/merge for `if`. Recursive borrow-escape walk
  (catches nested `View(?user)`). Pointer-type prune. Lexer hygiene
  (`suffix_bang` in value-end, `pending_close_bar` cleared on structural
  tokens). Emitter `name_arena` for shadow names (no test-allocator leak).
  Single-quoted strings lower to Zig double-quoted. Doc refresh.

### M5 — Real type checking ✅
Landed across 6 sub-commits, each with a GPT-5.5 design checkpoint:

- **M5(1/n):** `src/types.zig` foundation. `SemContext`, `TypeStore`
  interner, `Symbol` / `Scope`, stable `SymbolId` / `ScopeId` /
  `TypeId`. Symbol resolution pass populates module-scope and nested
  scopes (fn body, block, for, catch, arm) with all declarations.
- **M5(2/n):** Type expression resolution. Each declared type Sexp
  (`(error_union T)`, `(optional T)`, `(borrow_read T)`, etc.) is
  converted to a `TypeId` and written back into the symbol's `ty`
  slot. Functions get a complete `function` Type with param + return
  types. Unknown nominal names silently return `invalid_id` (deferred
  diagnostic — Rig has no module system yet).
- **M5(3/n):** Expression typing. `synthExpr` / `checkExpr` /
  `checkStmt` walk function bodies with statement-vs-value context.
  Literal pseudo-types (`int_literal` / `float_literal`) adapt to
  declared sized numerics. Value-position `if` requires `else` and
  unifies arms; statement-position arms walk independently. Calls
  check arity + arg types against the resolved signature. Returns
  check against the declared return type. Diagnostics with
  `formatType` rendering (e.g., `Int`, `U8`, `String`, `User?`,
  `[]Int`).
- **M5(4/n):** Effects checker consumes `SemContext`. Local
  `FunSig` collection replaced with sema-driven lookup; the same
  M4.5 visibility rules apply via the authoritative symbol table.
- **M5(5/n):** Ownership consumes `SemContext` for Copy/Move
  classification. Copy primitives (`Bool`, `Int`, `Float`, `String`,
  literal pseudo-types) skip the move/drop/write-borrow checks in
  `checkPlainUse`; Move types still follow the conservative M4.5
  rules. Position-based binding-to-symbol matching avoids lockstep
  scope tracking.
- **M5(6/n):** Emitter consumes `SemContext` for constructor
  disambiguation. `Foo(...)` lowers to a struct literal when sema
  resolves `Foo` to a nominal type, a function call when it
  resolves to a function, and falls back to the kwarg-presence
  heuristic only for unresolved names.

Success criteria from the M5 design pass — all met:
```
fun foo() -> Int    # body uses bar()! → effects + sema both fire
fun foo() -> Int!   # OK
x = fallible()      # effects fires (sema lookup confirms fallibility)
x = fallible()!     # OK
x = if cond 1 else 2          # types as Int
x = if cond 1 else "no"       # type error: incompatible if arms
```

Pipeline post-M5:
```
parse → normalize → sema (symbols + types + expr typing)
                 → effects (sema)
                 → ownership (sema, with Copy/Move classification)
                 → emit (sema, with constructor disambiguation)
```

### M6 — Struct field metadata + member typing ✅
Closes the two biggest M5-deferred items: member access now resolves
to declared field types, and constructor invocations are validated
against the field list (names + types + arity + duplicates).

- New `Field` type + `Symbol.fields` slice. `TypeResolver` populates
  it from `(struct Name (: field type) ...)` declarations.
- `synthMember` resolves `obj.name` via the obj's nominal type's field
  list. Unknown fields fire a sourced diagnostic.
- `synthCall` for nominal callees calls `checkConstructorArgs` which
  enforces real-field names, assignability, no-duplicates, and
  no-missing-fields. Now correctly returns `nominal(SymId)` instead
  of `unknown_id` (an M5 oversight that broke member typing on
  user-defined types).
- `emit.emitStruct` lowers `(struct Name (...))` to Zig
  `pub const Name = struct { ... };`. Combined with M5(6/n)'s
  constructor disambiguation, `bin/rig run` works end-to-end on
  struct programs.

### M7 — Enum + error-set typing & lowering ✅
Closes the enum half of M6's deferred list. Enum declarations
populate per-variant fields, enum literals (`.red`) type-check
against the contextually expected enum, and both `enum` and `error`
declarations lower to clean Zig.

- `TypeResolver.resolveEnumVariants` walks `(enum Name v...)` and
  `(errors Name v...)` (same IR shape) and stores variants as fields.
- `checkExpr` intercepts `(enum_lit name)` against an expected
  nominal enum and validates the variant exists. Unknown variant →
  `error: no variant 'purple' on enum 'Color'`.
- `emit.emitEnum` lowers to `pub const X = enum { ... };`. When any
  variant has an explicit value, falls back to `enum(u32)` so
  Zig accepts the explicit tag.
- `emit.emitErrorSet` lowers to `pub const X = error { ... };` so
  future fallible signatures compose naturally with `try`.
- `print` polish: when sema knows the arg's type is `String` (bare
  identifier OR struct member access), emit uses `{s}` instead of
  `{any}`. `struct_basic.rig` now prints `Steve` not byte codes.

### M8+ — Beyond V1
Match / try-block lowering (currently `@compileError` placeholders),
payload-bearing enum variants, qualified enum access (`Color.red`),
explicit error sets in `T!E` return types, opaque types, generic
struct lowering (parsed in M0, typed as opaque nominals in M6),
method syntax on structs, stdlib seed (Vec, HashMap, String, Result,
Option), module system, LSP, async/coroutines, and the eventual fold
of `effects.zig` into `types.zig` once expression typing is rich
enough to express "non-fallible expected here" naturally.

## Beyond V1 (deferred per SPEC §V2/V3)

Async, advanced shared ownership, allocator traits, reflection, full trait/interface system, advanced lifetime inference, richer pre-metaprogramming.

Parsed-but-lightly-enforced for V1: shared, weak, pin, unsafe/raw.

## Non-goals

- LLVM backend (Zig handles it)
- Garbage collection (ownership instead)
- Macro system (favor `pre` + library design)
- Trait system V1 (deferred)
