//! Rig's allocator for release builds: a heap per thread, with no lock,
//! as mimalloc keeps one. A heap hands out small blocks (up to
//! `max_small` bytes) from free lists, one per size class, which it fills
//! from pages of its own segments; a block freed on the thread whose heap
//! made it goes back on that heap's list with no atomic operation, and
//! one freed on another thread (a task's value that moved to another
//! core) goes on the owning heap's remote list, with one
//! compare-and-swap, for the owner to take back when its own list runs
//! out. Large blocks come from the system, and a heap keeps those freed
//! for the next, up to `keep_large` bytes, so a list that grows and a
//! buffer used again do not map and unmap memory each time. Segments are
//! never returned to the system: memory freed stays for reuse. On Linux,
//! the heap that does the program's work, one that has taken from the
//! system most of what every heap has, faults in at once the memory it
//! is about to fill (`prefault`).
//!
//! A thread that ends gives its heap back (`threadExit`), and the next
//! thread to start takes it, with what it holds.
//!
//! In a program that reads `os.memory` (`counts`), each heap counts the
//! bytes and blocks its thread takes and gives back, and adds them to the
//! program's totals in batches. Debug builds keep the leak checker's path
//! (`runtime.zig`, `defaultAllocator`).

// switch (`heap`), and between it and their last use of the heap they

//
// - The owner check (`mustOwn`): `my_heap` is written only by `newHeap`,

//   is used, is that thread's. The runtime's own tests keep the check, so
//   the scheduler's test of fibers that move between threads would catch
//   a fast path that used a stale heap.
// - The bounds check on `free[c]`: `c` is a `Class`, whose type bounds it
